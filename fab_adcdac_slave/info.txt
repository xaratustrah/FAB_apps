Firmware Application for FAB_ADC/DAC_Rev.C and later
----------------------------------------------------

05.03.2009/sh
This folder contains the code, equivalent to the fab_dac_dac_firmware02, 
but for FAB_ADCDAC_RevC and later revisions with the CYCLONE III FPGAs.

In this implementation, as in the case of fab_dac_dac_firmware02, the board is considered to be a slave to the FIB board.
This means that the FAB Board will be clocked from FIB and will answer to the data request of the FIB Board.
